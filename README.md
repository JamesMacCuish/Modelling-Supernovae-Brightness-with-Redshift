# Modelling-Supernovae-Brightness-with-Redshift
This repository computes the Gaussian likelihood of real apparent supernovae brightness data with a numerical integration method dependent on the number of steps 'n'. A convergence plot is shown with the best wavlue of 'n' then used with scipy minimize to find
the best fitting parameters cosmological parameters for certain models of Universe. This test a couple of models, including a free one, and one which confines Omega lambda to zero. The residuals of each model versus the observed data are also plotted.
